Since the gradual process of policy normalisation was initiated in December 2021, the Governing Council has pledged to act against resurgent fragmentation risks. The pandemic has left lasting vulnerabilities in the euro area economy which are indeed contributing to the uneven transmission of the normalisation of our monetary policy across jurisdictions.Based on this assessment, the Governing Council decided that it will apply flexibility in reinvesting redemptions coming due in the PEPP portfolio, with a view to preserving the functioning of the monetary policy transmission mechanism, a precondition for the ECB to be able to deliver on its price stability mandate. In addition, the Governing Council decided to mandate the relevant Eurosystem Committees together with the ECB services to accelerate the completion of the design of a new anti-fragmentation instrument for consideration by the Governing Council.For media queries, please contact Paul Gordon, tel.: +49 69 1344 23476.

Because of their concerns about rising property prices, interest rate increases, and elevated inflation, households are inclined to borrow at the expense of savings. Household credit growth in Slovakia has for some time been among the highest in Europe. More recently, corporate lending has also been picking up, as firms seek to meet their financing needs for working capital and fixed investment.Increasing possibility of a build-up of imbalancesFinancial sector developments have for some time now been creating conditions for a build-up of imbalances. These imbalances are related to the evolution of the financial cycle, which has recently been on a strong upswing. At the same time, there are signs of possible underestimation of risk.Countercyclical capital buffer rate raised from 1% to 1.5%In response to rising imbalances and current developments in the financial sector, NBS has decided to increase the countercyclical capital buffer (CCyB) rate by 50 basis points, to 1.5%, with effect from 1 August 2023. Risks associated with the financial cycle's expansionary phase are adding to risks accumulated in banks' portfolios. The financial market's upward trends look set to continue, despite the ongoing war in Ukraine and rising prices of goods and energy. NBS stands ready to respond immediatelyNBS does not envisage any further raising of the CCyB rate in the next quarter. Meanwhile, NBS is monitoring the risks present and perceives heightened market uncertainty stemming from the uptrend in inflation and the war in Ukraine. If financial market developments require it to do so, NBS is ready to reduce the CCyB rate with immediate effect.

Moreover, if inflation continues to rise, its adverse impact on financial stability could become even more pronounced.Certain firms are at risk of financial difficultiesOn the whole, firms coped reasonably well with the pandemic crisis. Even so, they have still not fully rebounded and are therefore still somewhat vulnerable to new shocks. Some firms in particular may face financial difficulties, and it is estimated that as many as 17% of corporate loans could be problematic within three years.Households appear more resilient but also face risksHousing loans are not expected to be a source of significant losses. In the case of consumer credit, however, delinquency risk is an issue, and we are already seeing an increase in the default rate.Inflation will have an important say. Households should keep track of their finances and trim their expenditure as and when necessary.Growth in household investment demandHousehold demand for pension and investment fund products has been increasing at a record pace, stoked to some extent by gradually rising inflation. Equity investments have become increasingly popular, particularly among younger customers.Housing prices continue to surgeHousing price growth continues to outpace household income growth. Housing affordability, while still relatively favourable, is rapidly deteriorating. If interest rates continue to rise, housing will become less and less affordable. Hence the upward pressure on housing prices can be expected to moderate.NBS to respond to strong household loan growth by adjusting the debt-to-income ratio limitDespite the climate of uncertainty, housing loan growth has accelerated further and even consumer credit growth has picked up. This trend, however, entails new risks to which NBS must respond. The current calibration of regulatory lending limits is generally sound. One problem, however, is the extension of housing loan maturities to beyond the borrower's retirement age. This is partly caused by households repeatedly increasing their existing borrowing. NBS is therefore proposing to partially adjust the debt-to-income (DTI) ratio limit, but only for loans that extend beyond retirement age. This will have almost no effect on the current market, but it will prevent housing loan maturities being shifted further into retirement.                   Frequently asked questions to news for loans that extend beyond retirement age (in Slovak)              NBS supports the transition to a green economyIt is proposed to ease regulatory lending requirements for house renovation loans, so as to support financing under a green project included in Slovakia's recovery and resilience plan.Banks and insurers remain profitable, well capitalised and resilient even under an adverse stress scenarioThe profitability trends of banks and insurers remain favourable. Solvency has increased in both sectors, and stress testing confirms the financial sector's resilience. Nevertheless, the financial cycle is in an expansionary phase and NBS is therefore considering raising the countercyclical capital buffer rate.

The first such board-to-board meeting between the Governing Board of Banka Slovenije and the Bank Board of Narodna banka Slovenska provided a scenic opportunity to discuss current economic issues, monetary policy, financial sector stability and, last but not least, financial literacy and education.The elevated inflation rate, energy prices, and the labour market situation were at the centre of the discussion on future expected prices increases. There was consensus on the causes of this development, namely the negative impact of the war in Ukraine and the ongoing post-pandemic economic recovery. These two factors are driving up prices for commodities, energy, and food across the euro area.A second important issue was lending to the household and corporate sectors in the context of looming interest rate increases. Discussions dwelt on the effects of monetary policy tightening, the state of the financial sector, and risks for the future.As for financial literacy, both central banks view it as a strategic priority and part of their social responsibility, even though their mandates do not require action in this area. Higher financial literacy not only protects consumers and family budgets, but also has a positive impact on the stability of the whole financial sector in the long term."]},

{"date": "13. 6. 2022", "labels": ["Press Release of the ECB"], "name": "Monetary policy decisions", "link": "https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/pr/date/2022/html/ecb.mp220609~122666c272.en.html", "content": ["9 June 2022High inflation is a major challenge for all of us. The Governing Council will make sure that inflation returns to its 2% target over the medium term.In May inflation again rose significantly, mainly because of surging energy and food prices, including due to the impact of the war. But inflation pressures have broadened and intensified, with prices for many goods and services increasing strongly. Eurosystem staff have revised their baseline inflation projections up significantly. These projections indicate that inflation will remain undesirably elevated for some time. However, moderating energy costs, the easing of supply disruptions related to the pandemic and the normalisation of monetary policy are expected to lead to a decline in inflation. The new staff projections foresee annual inflation at 6.8% in 2022, before it is projected to decline to 3.5% in 2023 and 2.1% in 2024 - higher than in the March projections. This means that headline inflation at the end of the projection horizon is projected to be slightly above the Governing Council's target. Inflation excluding energy and food is projected to average 3.3% in 2022, 2.8% in 2023 and 2.3% in 2024 - also above the March projections. Russia's unjustified aggression towards Ukraine continues to weigh on the economy in Europe and beyond. It is disrupting trade, is leading to shortages of materials, and is contributing to high energy and commodity prices. These factors will continue to weigh on confidence and dampen growth, especially in the near term. However, the conditions are in place for the economy to continue to grow on account of the ongoing reopening of the economy, a strong labour market, fiscal support and savings built up during the pandemic. Once current headwinds abate, economic activity is expected to pick up again. This outlook is broadly reflected in the Eurosystem staff projections, which foresee annual real GDP growth at 2.8% in 2022, 2.1% in 2023 and 2.1% in 2024. Compared with the March projections, the outlook has been revised down significantly for 2022 and 2023, while for 2024 it has been revised up.On the basis of its updated assessment, the Governing Council decided to take further steps in normalising its monetary policy. Throughout this process, the Governing Council will maintain optionality, data-dependence, gradualism and flexibility in the conduct of monetary policy. Asset purchase programme (APP) and pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP)The Governing Council decided to end net asset purchases under its asset purchase programme (APP) as of 1 July 2022. The Governing Council intends to continue reinvesting, in full, the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the APP for an extended period of time past the date when it starts raising the key ECB interest rates and, in any case, for as long as necessary to maintain ample liquidity conditions and an appropriate monetary policy stance.As concerns the pandemic emergency purchase programme (PEPP), the Governing Council intends to reinvest the principal payments from maturing securities purchased under the programme until at least the end of 2024. In any case, the future roll-off of the PEPP portfolio will be managed to avoid interference with the appropriate monetary policy stance.In the event of renewed market fragmentation related to the pandemic, PEPP reinvestments can be adjusted flexibly across time, asset classes and jurisdictions at any time. This could include purchasing bonds issued by the Hellenic Republic over and above rollovers of redemptions in order to avoid an interruption of purchases in that jurisdiction, which could impair the transmission of monetary policy to the Greek economy while it is still recovering from the fallout from the pandemic. Net purchases under the PEPP could also be resumed, if necessary, to counter negative shocks related to the pandemic.Key ECB interest ratesThe Governing Council undertook a careful review of the conditions which, according to its forward guidance, should be satisfied before it starts raising the key ECB interest rates. As a result of this assessment, the Governing Council concluded that those conditions have been satisfied. Accordingly, and in line with the Governing Council's policy sequencing, the Governing Council intends to raise the key ECB interest rates by 25 basis points at its July monetary policy meeting. In the meantime, the Governing Council decided to leave the interest rate on the main refinancing operations and the interest rates on the marginal lending facility and the deposit facility unchanged at 0.00%, 0.25% and -0.50% respectively.Looking further ahead, the Governing Council expects to raise the key ECB interest rates again in September. The calibration of this rate increase will depend on the updated medium-term inflation outlook. If the medium-term inflation outlook persists or deteriorates, a larger increment will be appropriate at the September meeting.Beyond September, based on its current assessment, the Governing Council anticipates that a gradual but sustained path of further increases in interest rates will be appropriate. In line with the Governing Council's commitment to its 2% medium-term target, the pace at which the Governing Council adjusts its monetary policy will depend on the incoming data and how it assesses inflation to develop in the medium term. Refinancing operationsThe Governing Council will continue to monitor bank funding conditions and ensure that the maturing of operations under the third series of targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTRO III) does not hamper the smooth transmission of its monetary policy. The Governing Council will also regularly assess how targeted lending operations are contributing to its monetary policy stance. As announced previously, the special conditions applicable under TLTRO III will end on 23 June 2022. ***The Governing Council stands ready to adjust all of its instruments, incorporating flexibility if warranted, to ensure that inflation stabilises at its 2% target over the medium term. The pandemic has shown that, under stressed conditions, flexibility in the design and conduct of asset purchases has helped to counter the impaired transmission of monetary policy and made the Governing Council's efforts to achieve its goal more effective. Within the ECB's mandate, under stressed conditions, flexibility will remain an element of monetary policy whenever threats to monetary policy transmission jeopardise the attainment of price stability.The President of the ECB will comment on the considerations underlying these decisions at a press conference starting at 14:30 CET today.

But our ambition is to go further. We have established the NBS Foundation because we want to provide help where and how we can - in areas in which we excel.

That's why we are setting up the Foundation, the Bank's extended arm in the areas of education, financial literacy development, and R&D support. I believe that by combining all our strengths and common sense, we will take financial literacy in Slovakia to a higher level.\"     Peter KazimirNBS Governor The context:We believe that people who manage their money well are better off and, conversely, that those who do not have a firm grip on their finances are comparatively far worse off in terms of quality of life.In general, R&D in Slovakia lags behind the EU average, and the situation is even worse in the field of economics. We therefore want to help our leading institutions and scientists bridge the gap.    ,,Quality data, innovative approaches to education and research, international connections: these are the areas of education and science in which Slovakia is lagging behind. The central bank, for its part, does not want to stand idly by. Within the scope of our mandate and financial capacity, we will open up new opportunities for the development of education and research in the fields of economics, finance, and financial literacy.\"     Michal HorvathChair of the Board of Trustees of the NBS Foundation What do we excel in?Supporting financial education and financial literacy. The decisions you take in life directly depend on the knowledge and information you possess. This is much more the case when it comes to decisions about personal investments, household budgets, and borrowing.    ,,We are reaching out to vulnerable groups of citizens, schools and pensioners, as well as to established institutions advancing long-standing efforts. Our hope is that by being able to lean on the steady shoulder of an experienced, professional and perceptive partner in financial matters, they will gain the energy and appetite to pursue new approaches and take bold steps. We want to be there where they need us.\"     Jana KovacovaManaging Director of the NBS Foundation One of the aims of the NBS Foundation is to support scientific talent and research in Slovakia, which is lagging behind in many areas, especially economic science.
